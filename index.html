                <p>This development startup company is an analogy to the structure and functions of the <strong>cell.</strong> 
                This model may include, but not all, the major components of a startup company.</p>

                    <p>Just like how <strong>cytoplasm</strong> holds all the important processes inside the cell, the <strong>office building</strong> makes collaborative work between all of the startup company employees.</p>

                    <p>While the cell requires energy to do its functions, primarily produced by the <strong>mitochondria</strong> in the form of ATP, the startup also needs some fuel to keep it running, which is the investments given by the <strong>investors</strong>.</p>

                    <p>This is where the most important function of a startup comes up, developing the product. In the same way <strong>ribosomes</strong> synthesize proteins based on the instructions from the nucleus, the project plan from the CEO is being synthesized here by the <strong>developing team</strong>, from programming the app to do its tasks, to the design and animation of its parts, are all coded by the developers.</p>
